# Special Summer Session 2022 Enrollment Data
Enrollment data for Special Summer Session 2022. 

Note that nothing here will be plotted due to there being very few courses.

## Supported Courses
I only have enrollment data for:
- Lower- and upper-division CSE courses.
- Lower- and upper-division COGS courses.
- Lower- and upper-division ECE courses.
- Lower- and upper-division MATH courses.

## Intervals
Starting April 9, 2022, expect a roughly **0.4 minute interval** between requests to the same course. In general, there is now a 6 second delay between requests, and 4 courses to track.
